-Added a python solution to leetcode #9 on 03/18/22, is an integer a palindrome (without converting to a string)  
-Added java solution to leetcode #26 on 03/30/22, remove duplicate integers from a sorted array  
-Added python solutions to leetcode problems #217 and #344 on 04/01/2022, I don't fully understand the bitwise solution on "Reverse a String"  
will add an explanation when I look it up!<br>
-Added a python solution to leetcode #700 on 04/14/22, not terribly difficult, just needed to look up the syntax<br>
-Added a python solution to leetcode #35 on 04/27/22, not hard, implementing a binary search is the idea behind this question<br>
-Added a python solution to leetcode #2011 on 04/29/22, three ways to solve the problem, last solution was definitely the fastest<br>
-Added a python solution to leetcode #35 on 05/01/22<br>
-Added a solution to leetcode #905 on 05/02/22, sort array by even/odd parity, solution is not optimized, will be writing a new one shortly<br>
-Added a solution to leetcode #225 on 05/05/22, implement a stack using a queue, the only tricky bit about this question was making the insert method<br>
-Added a java solution to leetcode #1502 on 05/08/22, can make arithmetic progression from sequence<br>
-Added a python solution to leetcode #1108 on 05/08/22, defanging an IP address<br>
-Added a java and python solution to leetcode #1523 on 05/08/22, count odd numbers in an interval range<br>
-Added a python solution to leetcode #2114 on 05/10/22, count the max number of words in a sentence<br>
-Added a java solution to leetcode #1431 on 05/14/22, Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies, trivial solution, figuring out optimizations<br>
-Added a python solution to leetcode #771 on 05/14/22, Jewels And Stones, basically wanted a naive implementation of a hash table (or dict in python)<br>
-Added a java solution to leetcode #1528 on 05/17/22, Shuffle String, the tricky bit was trying to figure out how to "unshuffle" the string with the indices<br>
-Added a python solution to leetcode #1389 on 05/18/22, Create Target Array in the Given Order, doing via python almost feels like cheating<br>
-Added a python solution to leetcode #938 on 05/22/22, Range Sum of a Binary Search Tree, once traversal is figured out, the difficulty is trivial <br> 
-Added a python solution to leetcode #1773 on 05/25/22, Count Items Matching a Rule, simple case and search <br>
-Added a python solution to leetcode #1859 on 05/25/22, Sorting the Sentence, used split, join, and list slicing <br>
-Added a python solution to leetcode #191 on 05/26/22, Number of 1 Bits <br>
-Added a python solution to leetcode #1342 on 05/26/22, Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero, got this one in one try <br>
-Added a python solution to leetcode #268 on 05/27/22, Missing Number, overcomplicating the solution made this problem more trouble than it was worth <br>
-Added a python solution to leetcode #1221 on 05/29/22, Split a String in Balanced Strings, once the algo was realized, it was very easy <br>
-Added two python solutions to leetcode #53 on 05/31/22, Maximum Subarray, once I familiarized myself with the max function and realized it was a simple summation problem, the initial difficulty faded away <br>
